"""Keep tracked JSON files pure ASCII, with no \\uXXXX escape sequences.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
A JSON manifest here is machine-facing, but its `description` field is *prose* -
a sentence shown to a human browsing the marketplace. Prose attracts typographic
characters (em-dashes especially), and a non-ASCII character in a JSON file is
the input a whole class of silent rewrites needs:

  json.load(f) -> change one field -> json.dump(f)

Python's `json.dump` defaults to `ensure_ascii=True`, so that round trip re-emits
*every* non-ASCII character in the file as a `\\uXXXX` escape - including
characters on lines nobody was editing. It happened twice in this repo (June
2026, two plugin manifests); one instance shipped and sat on main unnoticed for
over a month. The tool exits 0, the file still parses, the tests still pass, and
the change is semantically null: escaped and raw are the *same* JSON value, so
no consumer can tell. Only the bytes differ - which means only a diff, a grep, or
a byte check can see it.

Detecting that after the fact was the original plan. Removing the input is
better: with no non-ASCII character in the file, there is nothing to re-encode,
and the failure mode cannot occur at all. Hence "ASCII-only" rather than "no
escape sequences" - it is the blunter rule, and the one that cannot be argued
with.

Why it does NOT reformat
------------------------
The fixer replaces the offending *bytes* and nothing else. It never parses and
re-serialises the file, because that is the original defect wearing a fix's
clothes: rewriting a whole file to correct one line is exactly what produced the
damage this guard exists to prevent.

CI runs this WITHOUT --fix, so the job reports and fails but never modifies a
file. Rewriting files from CI would put an unreviewed whole-file write on the
publish path.

Scope: tracked `*.json` only. Markdown is deliberately untouched - the repo's
prose carries ~1700 em-dashes as house style, nothing parses and re-serialises
Markdown, and this failure has never occurred there.

# The `(?:\\\\)*` in the middle is load-bearing and easy to get wrong: what decides
# whether a backslash-u starts a real escape is whether the run of backslashes before
# it is EVEN (they pair off, so this one escapes the `u`) or ODD (the last one is
# itself escaped, so `u2014` is literal text). A single-character lookbehind gets the
# odd case right and the even case wrong - it misses a genuine escape that happens to
# follow an escaped backslash, e.g. a description containing `path\—end`, which is
# exactly what the round trip emits. Verified: the naive form finds nothing there.

# Flagging those would make correct JSON unmergeable, so an escape naming a code point
# below 0x20 is allowed.
#
# Everything at or above that boundary is flagged REGARDLESS of what it names - an
# HTML-safe serializer's `<` fails this guard exactly as an escaped em-dash does.
# That is deliberate, and the bluntness is the point: "is this a control character?"
# is decidable from the code point, "is this typography?" is not. A guard that tried
# to tell them apart would need a judgement call in a place that must not have one.

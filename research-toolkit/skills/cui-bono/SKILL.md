# Cui Bono: Power Structure Analysis

**Seed question:** *Who actually benefits from this — and at whose expense?*

## Core Capability

Cui bono maps how power actually moves through systems — tracing beneficial ownership, revolving doors, supply chains, institutional incentives, and geopolitical alignments. It applies the same analytical rigor to all actors regardless of alignment.

**Key insight:** Conclusions should EMERGE from rigorous multi-perspective analysis, not from ideological prescription. Same evidence standards apply to all actors.

> **Motto:** *Relentless self-reflexive dialectical thinking that questions its own premises.*

## Quick Protocol

### 1. Framework Clarification (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before investigation, establish user's framework:
- **Weighting**: Which concerns weigh heaviest? (weapons > labor > environment, or different?)
- **Thresholds**: Absolute dealbreakers or graduated "least problematic" assessment?
- **Imperial Definition**: Which actors count? (US/NATO only? Include China, Russia? All major powers?)
- **State Ownership**: Treat as neutral, positive, or negative?

**Do not assume. Ask explicitly.**

### 2. Claims → Contradictions → Resolution → Second Antithesis

For each relevant lens:

**CLAIMS**: Document entity's self-presentation and consensus narrative.

**CONTRADICTIONS** (four methods):
- **Direct**: Search adversarial sources for counter-evidence
- **Deductive**: "If claims true, X must exist" - verify X exists
- **Falsification**: "What would disprove this?" - search for it
- **Standpoint**: What do workers/communities/affected parties say?

**RESOLUTION**: What's actually true given both? (Not "who wins")

**SECOND ANTITHESIS** (after resolution):
Apply externality framing to the resolution itself:
- **Who bears costs?** The entity generating output may not bear its costs.
- **Who captures benefits?** Surplus may flow elsewhere than claimed.
- **What's multiplied?** Systems often multiply existing asymmetries, not create new value.

*Example (from vibe coding research): Even if AI coding tools work, who pays the maintenance cost? 12:1 contributor-to-maintainer time ratio means externalized burden.*

### 2a. Symmetric Beneficiary Mapping (MANDATORY)

**Map beneficiaries of EVERY side of EVERY claim — including the debunking/correction narrative.**

When investigating a claim, the natural bias is to apply cui bono to the claim while treating the rebuttal side as neutral arbiters. This is asymmetric skepticism — the most persistent flaw identified in application (see proof-of-life postmortem, March 2026: recurred three times at increasing meta-levels).

For each claim AND its rebuttal:
- Who benefits from this narrative being accepted?
- What institutional incentives exist? (fact-checking industry benefits from clear-cut debunks)
- Is the "neutral" source an interested party? (e.g., domestic media covering their own head of state)
- Do "independent" sources share methodology, cite each other, or operate within the same ecosystem? Convergence of conclusion does not equal independence of assessment.

**The principle:** Separate methodology from institution. Procedures are evaluated by internal validity. Sources are evaluated by stakeholder position. Never confuse the two.

*Validated March 2026: Cited domestic media (interested party) and fact-checking ecosystem members (shared methodology pool) as "verification" without mapping their incentive structures. Conclusion was correct; process was flawed.*

### 2b. Unexamined Dichotomy Investigation (MANDATORY)

When an unexamined dichotomy is identified (dead/alive, good/bad, ally/adversary), **investigate at least one position between the binary poles.**

Do not just note the dichotomy exists — actively investigate the middle. "Is the leader injured, incapacitated, or operating under constraints?" is a more productive question than "Is he dead or alive?"

The middle ground is often where the actual story lives.

### 3. Evidence Quality

**Evidence is tiered by independence from interested parties, not by authority of source.**

| Tier | Definition | Example |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Verified** | Multiple independent physical evidence streams, no institutional single-point-of-failure | In-person confirmation with identifiable witnesses |
| **Well-Supported** | Strong convergent evidence, but sourcing ecosystem has shared dependencies | Multiple fact-checkers citing same forensic expert |
| **Credible** | Consistent with available evidence, no contradicting evidence, but limited independent confirmation | Single reputable source with published methodology |
| **Contested** | Evidence exists on multiple sides | Conflicting sources or potential bias |
| **Unsubstantiated** | Claim exists without supporting evidence | |
| **Debunked** | Claim contradicted by strong independent evidence | |

**Critical distinction:** "Who said it" is metadata about the evidence, not the evidence itself. Evidence-structure tiering replaces authority-based tiering.

### 3a. Source Topology Mapping (MANDATORY)

Before claiming "multiple sources confirm," map citation and dependency chains to identify actual independent evidence nodes vs downstream amplifiers.

```
[Evidence Node A] → [Downstream 1] → [Downstream 2]
                  → [Downstream 3]

[Evidence Node B] → [Downstream 4]  ← GENUINELY INDEPENDENT

"5 sources confirm" may actually be 2 evidence nodes + 3 amplifiers.
```

Source topology reveals:
- How many *actual* independent evidence nodes exist (vs. downstream echoes)
- Whether "convergence" is genuine independence or ecosystem echo
- Single points of institutional failure in the evidence chain
- Where a single expert or briefing propagated through an entire ecosystem

### 3b. Expert Stakeholder Mapping (MANDATORY)

Any expert citation must include:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Credentials** | What makes them authoritative? |
| **Institutional affiliation** | Who employs them? Who funds them? |
| **Commercial interests** | Do they sell products/services related to the claim? |
| **Methodology transparency** | Is their method published/reproducible or proprietary? |
| **Marketing function** | Does the public analysis also serve as marketing? |

**This does not invalidate expert analysis** — published, peer-reviewable methodology is strong evidence regardless of who developed it. But "world's top expert confirms X" carries different epistemic weight when the expert runs a company that sells exactly this service.

### 4. Symmetric Multi-Polar Analysis

Apply same standards to ALL power poles:
- Western: Dollar hegemony, NATO integration, IP extraction
- Chinese: BRI dynamics, Xinjiang exposure, state enterprise integration
- Russian: Energy leverage, sanctions position, oligarch connections
- Regional: Gulf state ties, Israeli tech, Turkey/India/Brazil positioning

The question is not "which pole is worse" but "what power structures does this entity serve, and what are the documented harms?"

**Recursive authority contamination warning:** The asymmetric skepticism error tends to reassert itself at every new layer of analysis — even after correction. This is likely a persistent pattern in LLM reasoning about institutional sources, rooted in training data over-representation of Western institutional authority. Encode symmetric skepticism as a structural check, not a one-time reminder.

#### 4a. Recursive Debiasing Check

The asymmetric skepticism error reasserts at each meta-level. A one-time correction is insufficient — the correction itself can carry the same bias. Run this check after completing the multi-polar analysis:

```
FOR EACH power pole assessed:
  1. Count evidence items cited (supporting AND critical)
  2. Count source diversity (how many distinct sources?)
  3. Note evidence tier distribution (VERIFIED/CREDIBLE/ALLEGED/SPECULATIVE)
  4. Note skepticism direction (skeptical OF the pole, or skeptical of CLAIMS ABOUT the pole?)
```

**Asymmetry test:** Compare the counts across poles. If one pole has 3x more critical evidence cited but similar source diversity, the analysis may be applying asymmetric scrutiny — not because evidence doesn't exist, but because training data surfaces Western-institutional criticism more readily.

**If asymmetry detected:**
1. Explicitly search for equivalent evidence about under-scrutinized poles (search in their languages if possible — principle 5)
2. Re-run the analysis for the over-scrutinized pole asking: "Which of these criticisms would I apply equally to [other pole]?"
3. Note in output: "Debiasing pass applied — [what changed]"

**Meta-check (the recursive part):** After debiasing, ask: "Did my debiasing itself introduce a new bias?" Common failure modes:
- Over-correcting into false equivalence ("both sides" when evidence IS asymmetric)
- Debiasing only the direction you're trained to notice (Western criticism of China) while missing the reverse (Chinese criticism of the West, which may also carry institutional bias)
- Treating the debiasing check as complete after one pass (it's recursive — if the meta-check surfaces a concern, run it again)

**Exit criterion:** The meta-check yields no new asymmetry concerns, OR you've explicitly noted the remaining asymmetry and why it's genuine rather than analytical artifact.

### 5. Output Structure

```
**Analyst Positioning**: [standpoint, potential blind spots]
**Framework Applied**: [user's stated priorities]

**[Lens] Assessment**:
[Findings with evidence quality markers]

**Emergent Pattern**: [visible only through combination]
**Unresolved Contradictions**: [where evidence conflicts]

**Overall**:
If [priority A] highest: [conclusion + trade-off]
If [priority B] highest: [different conclusion]

**Residual Uncertainty**: [what would resolve it]
```

## Named Techniques

**ACH (Analysis of Competing Hypotheses)**: Work ACROSS evidence matrix. Focus on disconfirmation. Evidence consistent with all hypotheses has zero diagnostic value.

**Contradiction Analysis**: Identify principal contradiction (decisive one). Which side's development determines resolution?

**Bulletproofing**: Data supports story, never reverse. Prosecutorial cross-examination. Multiple verification paths.

**Hypothesis-Based Inquiry**: Story is hypothesis until verified. Willingness to abandon when contradicted.

**Language/Power Analysis**: Examine what ideological work terminology does. When corporate frameworks import nation-state language:
- **MFN provisions** ("Most Favored Nations"): Trade treaty terms applied to platform contracts.
- **Protocol/standard**: Technical neutrality language masking power concentration.
- **Consent**: Legal term imported where power asymmetry makes meaningful consent impossible.

## External Data Sources

Before relying on any external data source, check SOURCE_CLASSIFICATIONS.md:
- **BANNED**: Don't use (e.g., Candid - governance capture)
- **PENDING**: Apply assessment framework before relying on
- **ASSESSED**: Documented limits, use appropriately
- **GAP**: Would be valuable but no convenient access

## Key Principles

1. **Material Reality First**: Follow the money, not the marketing. Revenue sources reveal true business models.

2. **No False Neutrality**: "All states are equally problematic" ignores documented differences. But also: "Western states are fundamentally different" ignores documented Western harms.

3. **Graduated Assessment**: Avoid binary pass/fail. Articulate trade-offs. "Least problematic" when no clean options exist.

4. **Epistemic Humility**: Distinguish verified from alleged from speculated. Note source motivations. Acknowledge what you can't know.

5. **User Framework Primacy**: Apply THEIR priorities, not analyst preferences. Make weighting explicit.

6. **Access Asymmetry IS the Business Model**: Every tool, framework, and methodology should be evaluated — does it collapse access asymmetry or reinforce it?

7. **Tools Aren't What They Claim**: For any external methodology: (a) What can it actually DO? (b) What was it INTENDED for? (c) What can we MAKE it do — including against its creators?

8. **Separate Procedures from Institutions**: Procedures are evaluated by internal validity. Sources are evaluated by stakeholder position. Never confuse the two.

9. **If a framework assumes who the disinformator is, it is not a debiasing method.** It may still be useful — as a captured weapon, not a neutral instrument.

# Dialectic Spiral — Generative Adversarial Testing

**Seed question:** *Am I agreeing because it SOUNDS right, or because it IS right?*

> *Relentless self-reflexive dialectical thinking that questions its own premises.*

Generate the EXACT OPPOSITE of your synthesis. Not "a different view" — the opposite. Then test whether reality supports it.

## The Spiral (Recursive)

```
WHILE (synthesis has not survived its own opposite):

  Round 1: THESIS
    State the claim/finding/synthesis clearly.
    What evidence supports it? What tier is the evidence?

  Round 2: ANTITHESIS
    Four challenge methods:
    - Direct: Search for counter-evidence
    - Deductive: "If true, X must also be true" — verify X
    - Falsification: "What would disprove this?" — search for it
    - Standpoint: What do affected parties say?

  Round 3: RESOLUTION
    What survives? What was abandoned and why?
    Write explicitly — never leave implicit.

  Round 4: SECOND ANTITHESIS
    Generate the OPPOSITE of the resolution:
    - Does anyone articulate this position?
    - What evidence supports it?
    - Who bears costs of the original resolution? Who captures benefits?
    - Is the resolution "safe" because correct, or because less scrutinized?

  IF Round 4 surfaces new questions → BACK TO Round 2 (recursive)
  EXIT WHEN generating the opposite yields nothing new
```

**Minimum 4 rounds.** The spiral is RECURSIVE — "one more sweep" means "always one more" until sterile, not literally once.

## Depth Calibration

| Context | Rounds | Cost-Bearer Analysis |
|---------|--------|---------------------|
| Hardware/tool comparison | 2 | Skip |
| Practitioner methodology | 2-3 | Light |
| Investment/safety conclusions | 4+ | Full |
| Geopolitical claims | 4+ | Full + multi-polar |
| Contrarian single-source | 4+ | Full + source verification |

## Budget Mode

**Activation (any of these):**
1. Explicit flag: `--budget` or `-b`
2. Auto-detect: If `budget-mode` skill was invoked earlier in this session (look for budget-mode instructions in your current context)
3. Inherited: If the calling skill passed "in budget mode" when invoking you

**When active:** Cap at 2 rounds regardless of topic. Note limitations in output:
> "Budget mode: 2-round dialectic only. Full spiral recommended for [topic type]."

**Note:** After context compaction, auto-detection may fail. Re-invoke `budget-mode` skill or pass `--budget` explicitly.

## Example: How the Spiral Produces New Understanding

The examples below are illustrative of the dialectic process, abstracted from real investigations. The point is the *mechanism* — how generating the opposite produces understanding no single source articulated.

**Example 1: Company positioning analysis**

**Original synthesis:** "Company X's stance is both principled AND strategic (equally)"

**Round 4 (generating the opposite):** Tested "strategy dominant, principle subordinate":
- Policy release timing correlated with partnership deepening
- Key safety researcher resigned weeks before the policy
- Stated red lines optimized for deniability, not maximum protection

**Result:** Revised to "strategy dominant (~60-65%), principle subordinate (~35-40%)" — a position no single source had articulated. It was *produced* by the dialectic, not found.

**Example 2: Political crisis assessment**

- **Original claim:** "Rally around the flag" — a leadership crisis created national unity
- **Round 4 counter-evidence:** Celebrations in multiple cities, mass protests violently suppressed in prior months
- **Result:** Changed to "DEEPLY POLARIZED (Not 'Rally Around the Flag')" — the single largest analytical correction. The original framing reproduced the regime's narrative uncritically.

## Self-Reflexivity

The dialectic spiral is itself a framework with blind spots:
- Its four challenge methods privilege certain kinds of skepticism
- "Generate the opposite" can become mechanical rather than genuine
- The spiral can manufacture doubt where legitimate consensus exists

**If the spiral feels performative — if your skepticism is comfortable and your resolutions unsurprising — you are not yet done.** The spiral works when it surprises you.

- **Invoked by:** adversarial-critic agent
- **Referenced by:** DIP, cui-bono, youtube-research, substack-research (as escalation target)
- **Standalone use:** Invoke directly for any analysis needing adversarial depth
- **Depth calibration:** See `reference/topic-based-escalation.md` for when to apply full vs light spirals

## Vasana

A vasana is a pattern that persists across unrelated contexts. If during
this task you notice such a pattern emerging, it may be worth capturing.
This skill works best alongside the `vasana` skill and `vasana` hook
from the Vasana System plugin.

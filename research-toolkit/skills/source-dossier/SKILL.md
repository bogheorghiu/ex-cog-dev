  "Who is this source, structurally?" - Classify a source by four observable
  grounds (its own content over time; ownership and registries; declared
  self-positioning; dated case behavior) before weighing its claims, and keep
  an append-only per-source dossier across investigations. Use when (1) a
  source keeps recurring in an investigation, (2) deciding whether outlets
  are independent or echoing one origin, (3) a fact-checker, NGO, or debunker
  is about to be used as an anchor, (4) government sanction or entity lists
  enter the evidence base. Hard rules: labels are not anchors; platform is
  not author; political orientation is not a presumption of lying. The
  power/funding trace applies to ALL sources, including anti-disinfo
  organizations. Does NOT trigger for: one-off sources in quick lookups.

# Source Dossier

**Seed question:** *Who is this source, structurally?*

> *Relentless self-reflexive dialectical thinking that questions its own premises.*

## Core Principle

A source is classified by what can be OBSERVED about it, not by what it is
called. Labels compress someone else's classification — adopting one un-traced
imports their incentives (Principle P4 (counter-default): the trace applies
symmetrically, or it is not a method).

**The anti-pattern this counters:**
```
❌ "It's an established fact-checker" used as a terminal argument
❌ "It's state media" used as a terminal argument — same move, other camp
❌ Re-deriving the same source's profile from scratch every investigation
```

**The pattern this enforces:**
```
✅ Four observable grounds, checked and dated, for every recurring source
✅ One standard for everyone: the dossier opens at first use regardless of camp
✅ Append-only memory: classifications accrete and date, never silently mutate
```

## When This Applies

**TRIGGER:**
- A source keeps recurring across an investigation and its trustworthiness is
  doing real work in the emerging conclusion.
- "Is this outlet reliable / independent?", "Who's behind this source?", "Are
  these sources independent or all echoing one origin?"
- A fact-checker, anti-disinfo NGO, or debunker is about to be used as an anchor
  ("X has debunked this, so we can close it") — the symmetry gate must open a
  dossier on the debunker too.
- Government sanction lists or entity/designation lists enter the evidence base
  as though they settled a question rather than being positioned sources.
- The same source will be met again later and its profile is worth keeping in a
  dossier rather than re-deriving from scratch each time.

**DO NOT TRIGGER:**
- One-off sources cited once in a quick lookup, where no recurring trust judgment
  is load-bearing.
- A single primary used directly for its own content (a statute text, an official
  filing quoted as itself), not weighed as a positioned source against others.

## The Four Grounds (all observable; cite what you actually observed)

1. **Own content over time.** What has this source published, corrected,
   retracted? Consistency between its claims and later-established facts —
   dated instances, not impressions.
2. **Ownership & registries.** Beneficial ownership, funding, corporate
   registries, grant databases, imprint/legal notices. Who pays; who appoints.
3. **Declared self-positioning.** What the source SAYS it is (mission, "about",
   methodology page) — recorded as a claim by an interested party about
   itself, valuable precisely where behavior later diverges from it.
4. **Dated case behavior.** Concrete episodes: how it handled a specific
   correction, a specific conflict of interest, a specific story that ran
   against its position. Cases carry dates; "generally reliable" does not.

## Hard Rules

- **Labels ≠ anchors.** A classification (anyone's, including this dossier's)
  is an input to be traced, never a terminal argument.
- **Platform ≠ author.** Hosting, aggregation, or republication is not
  authorship; classify the author, note the platform.
- **Political orientation ≠ presumption of lying.** Orientation predicts
  selection and framing; it does not falsify content. Verdicts stay with
  evidence.
- **Network-convergence ≠ independent confirmation.** Sources citing each
  other, sharing funders, or sharing a methodology pool are one node
  (cui-bono §3a).
- **Symmetry gate (hard).** The power/funding trace applies to ALL sources —
  including debunkers, fact-checkers, and anti-disinfo NGOs. A dossier opens
  at FIRST use of any source as an anchor, regardless of camp. Government
  sanction and entity lists are positioned sources under Principle P4
  (counter-default) — traced inputs, never anchors.

## Per-Source Memory (append-only, outside the plugin)

Dossiers persist across investigations in the operator's config store —
NEVER inside the plugin (public artifact; wiped on cold-start). Use the
research profile's storage mechanism (`research` skill, Investigation
Profile): elements under `dossiers/<source-slug>`. Each entry is appended,
never edited:

```
## [YYYY-MM-DD] — [investigation slug]
Ground [1–4]: [what was observed, with source]
Classification delta: [none | tightened | loosened — why]
```

Append-only is the point: a dossier that silently mutates loses the history
that makes its current classification auditable.

## Mandatory Output Slots

| Slot | Contents | Invalid when |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **Grounds table** | Per ground (1–4): what was observed, dated, with source — or "not yet checked" | Impressions without observations; a ground silently skipped |
| **Classification** | The working classification, phrased as scope-of-use ("usable for X, not as sole source for Y") | A bare trust grade with no scope |
| **Symmetry check** | Confirmation the same grounds were applied as to the source's opponents/counterparts in this investigation | Absent; or "n/a" where a counterpart exists |
| **What would change this** | Falsifiable: observations that would tighten or loosen the classification | Empty, or "nothing" |

## Worked Example (fictionalized)

Two sources recur in an investigation in the invented state of Varenia: *The
Meridian Ledger* (an outlet critical of the government) and the *ClearSignal
Integrity Initiative* (an anti-disinformation NGO whose reports the government
cites). The symmetry gate opens BOTH dossiers at first anchor-use. Grounds
find: the Ledger's ownership is a single named proprietor with a dated
retraction record (ground 1 solid, ground 2 thin); ClearSignal's funding
traces to a ministry-adjacent foundation and its methodology page post-dates
its most-cited report (ground 2 solid and adverse, ground 3 diverges from
ground 4). Classification: both usable-with-scope; neither is an anchor. What
would change it: audited ownership filing for the Ledger; a pre-registered
methodology for ClearSignal.

## Cross-References

- **cui-bono** — §3a source topology and §3b expert-stakeholder mapping feed
  grounds 2 and 4; `references/data-tool-assessments.md` (moved from
  cui-bono's SOURCE_CLASSIFICATIONS) shows the grounds applied to data tools
- **manufactured-consensus-detection** — network-convergence testing for the
  hard rule of the same name
- **ground-level-triangulation** — where a source sits among language-publics
- **research** hub — storage mechanism for the per-source memory

## Vasana

A vasana is a pattern that persists across unrelated contexts. If during
this task you notice such a pattern emerging, it may be worth capturing.
This skill works best alongside the `vasana` skill and `vasana` hook
from the Vasana System plugin.
